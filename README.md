## 1. To-Do List : 
The To-Do List Application helps users manage their day-to-day tasks easily. Through this feature, users can create, update, and delete tasks, as well as add priorities and mark them as completed. This application creates a service that is easily manageable with a simple, intuitive interface to enhance productivity.

## 2. Weather App:
The weather app is a simple Django-based application that enables users to search and see the current temperature data of various cities. The weather data is fetched from an external database or API (such as Weather API ) and shown on a user-friendly GUI.
A clean and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## 3. Event Count:
The Event Countdown Timer web application is a simple Django-based application that allows customers to set a selected date and time for an upcoming event, product launch, or special event that provides a visual representation of the closing time until the desired event occurs and creates expectations and interests of their own. The program uses Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create intuitive and user-friendly books. Users can conveniently enter the desired date and time, and the countdown time dynamically calculates and displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
